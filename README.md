## GotChosen Interview Project
 
Welcome to GotChosen! Following your interview today, you'll be given a take
home project so that we can test your ability to get up to speed on the tools
and technologies that we'll be using.
 
You will be working on implementing a very simple blogging app. You will
be using the Symfony 2 framework with Doctrine. You will need to put your
project up on GitHub, so you will need to create a GitHub account if you don't
have one already.
 
While you're implementing the project requirements, please commit often to your
repository so that we can get a good idea of your thought process behind the
implementation of new projects.
 
Project Requirements:
 
* Very simple Database just for storing Authors, Posts, and Tags
  * An author can have many posts
  * Posts may have many tags
* Implement a simple front-end for listing post titles that link to full posts
* Implement an admin interface for adding posts and authors
* You must implement your Controller Actions using Annotation Routing
* You must use the Doctrine ORM for your Models/Entities
* Please practice proper Separation of Concerns. (Hint: Does your business logic
belong in your Controllers?)
* Please also include a couple simple JSON-based APIs for pulling a list of blog
entry titles and single full posts
* Please copy the full text of this document and make it the README.md file in
the root of your Git repository
 
While you're developing the project, please keep a running note log of any
questions you have during the development process, even ones that you answer
yourself or find the answer to elsewhere. Make a note of how you answered the
questions you did and what resources you used to help in the development of the
project. Share all of that information with us when you send over your completed
project.
